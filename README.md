# 👋 Hi, I'm Bruno Manduré, a Full-Stack Developer

## 🧑‍ A Bit About Me
I'm a developer focused in the MERN stack with strong knowledge in SQL data bases.

I have always been interested in the IT industry, and I decided to take the path of the web developer, as I was attracted to the idea of having challenges that I can complete with my creativity.

In my free time, I enjoy solving Rubik's cubes and playing music.
